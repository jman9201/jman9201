I am currently enrolled in HyperionDev's Skills Bootcamp in Software Engineering (Fundamentals). Through this boot camp, I am gaining proficiency in essential programming concepts and tools, including data types and conditional statements, iteration, user-defined functions, string and dictionary manipulation, file IO operations, and object-oriented programming (OOP) classes.

Upon completing this boot camp, I aim to pursue opportunities in software engineering, leveraging my newfound skills to secure lucrative positions within the tech industry. Specifically, I aspire to join established tech companies or startups as a software engineer, contributing to developing innovative products and solutions.
